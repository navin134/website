Albert Einstein was one of the brightest minds in history, his very brain structure was full of anomolies constituting to his genious.
<br/>
He concieved what i would consider one of the greatest theories in history that changed the way we saw the world and the universe.
<br/>
the theory of general and special relativity may not be all encompassing but his idea of locality is the very reason for the existence of light in the universe.
<br/>
it may be true that with the conception of the wave function einsteins whole theory  breaks down but so far every experiment has proved his theory correct.
<p>
I chose Enstein as my hero because he was a philosopher a scientist and a pioneer in science, I hope to one day be as infleuncial as he although thats impossible.
<br/>
I have come quite far in my journey to create theories about theoretical physcis and in my engineering ideas but h's still ligt years away.
